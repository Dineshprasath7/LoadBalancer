# Load Balancer

This project provides a Python-based load balancer designed to distribute traffic efficiently. It supports dynamic load balancing algorithms, including:

- Least Connect
- Weighted Least Connect
- Least Response Time

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get started with the load balancer:

1. **Start the Load Balancer**

   Begin by launching the load balancer application. Ensure that it initializes correctly and is ready to accept traffic.

2. **Verify Server Status**

   Confirm that the server(s) you intend to balance traffic to are up and running. The load balancer will need to communicate with these servers to distribute requests properly.

3. **Connect the Client**

   Finally, configure your client to connect to the load balancer. Ensure that the client is set to send traffic to the load balancerâ€™s address.

By following these steps, you will be able to effectively utilize the load balancer to manage and distribute traffic across your servers.
